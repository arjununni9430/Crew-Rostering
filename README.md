# Crew-Rostering
This project aims to develop an efficient crew rostering and scheduling system for the aviation industry, focusing on optimizing crew assignments while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and contractual constraints. The project leverages data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and database management to streamline the crew scheduling process, enhance operational efficiency, and improve crew satisfaction.

The project involves collecting and integrating various datasets, including crew member information, flight schedules, regulatory requirements, and contractual constraints. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the datasets, identify patterns, and understand the underlying factors influencing crew assignments.

Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression, are employed to predict crew availability for specific flights based on features such as duty schedules, qualifications, and contractual constraints. These predictive models assist in automating crew assignment decisions and optimizing crew utilization while considering factors such as crew preferences, regulatory limitations, and operational requirements.

Furthermore, the project includes the development of a database management system to store and manage crew data, flight schedules, and regulatory requirements efficiently. The system facilitates seamless data retrieval, updates, and queries, supporting real-time decision-making and providing stakeholders with timely and accurate information.

Overall, the proposed crew rostering and scheduling system offer significant benefits to the aviation industry, including improved crew utilization, enhanced compliance with regulatory standards, reduced operational costs, and increased operational efficiency. By leveraging data-driven insights and machine learning techniques, the system enables airlines to adapt to dynamic operational requirements, optimize crew resources effectively, and deliver a superior travel experience to passengers.
